Description=This procedure estimates a  linear model with a link function for equations where the dependent variable is a proportion with a beta distribution.  Mean and precision parameters of the distribution are estimated.  Residuals and fitted values can be saved.  The estimated model can be saved and used for predictions on new data with the STATS PROPOR REGRPRED extension command.
Summary=Linear models for dependent variables that are proportions
